DeduplicateKeys
deduplicate method
If nested_dict is not a dictionary, add key-value pair to new dictionary
Use combinations to get a generator iterable of two-key combinations of the middle dictionary keys
Check if any individual key has been checked already
Check if two keys are similar with boolean method
Use prioritize_keys to provide sorted order to keys (plural, singular usually)
Use merge_values to combine values of keys
add key that values merged from to duplicate_keys set to be skipped in future iterations
create new inner dictionary with keys that are not in duplicate_keys set
add key-inner dictionary value to new dictionary

_is_similar_key
when value1 is a list and value2 is a dictionary, use ChainMap to merge the dictionary in value2 with any dictionaries in the list of value1, otherwise, just add the item to the new list. when done, check if the keys of the value2 dictionary are in the list, and if no, you can go in the list
